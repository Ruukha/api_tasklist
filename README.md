A simple project of a device that keeps track of your tasklist.
This project is divided in three parts:
    1. The device itself, which I tried to explain in device.txt.
    2. The software the device is running, which you can find in the client/ directory.
    3. The online API that keeps track of the trasks, found in api/.

My idea is to also create a website to control these tasks, so that you can add them from your computer of phone, and have them synchronised with your device.
So far, the API is the basic task controlling stuff, no control about who is the task owner, as this is made as a personal project so far,
but I try to make this project easily escalable, and I will work on different users on the future.
Both the app/ and api/ directories have their own documentation, which you can read for further information about each of those parts.
