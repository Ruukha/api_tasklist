The physical device is formed by an ESP32, a screen, a rotary encoder and a button.
The rotary encoder and button serve as user inputs to the screen. 
    Moving the encoder clockwise or counter-clockwise will change the selected task.
    Clicking the encoder will mark the selected task as completed.
    Clicking the button will just turn on or off the screen (not the device, just the peripherics. To turn off the device you should just disconnect it.)

I will try to explain how the device is set up in the near future.
